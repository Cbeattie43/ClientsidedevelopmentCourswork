        <p class="intro-text">When planning for retirement, choosing the right pension option is a crucial step. There are several types of pension plans that offer different benefits, tax implications, and investment opportunities. In this guide, we'll explore the various pension options available and help you determine which one suits your needs and retirement goals.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h2>Types of Pension Plans</h2>
            <div class="pension-cards">
                <div class="pension-card">
                    <h3>1. State Pension</h3>
                    <p>The state pension is a government-backed plan that provides a basic level of retirement income for individuals who have paid National Insurance contributions during their working years.</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Guaranteed income from the government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> May not provide enough for a comfortable retirement, and the amount varies depending on your contributions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="pension-card">
                    <h3>2. Employer-Sponsored Pension Plans</h3>
                    <p>Many employers offer pension plans that automatically enroll employees to help them save for retirement. The most common types include:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Defined Contribution Plans (DC):</strong> Contributions are invested, and the value depends on investment performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defined Benefit Plans (DB):</strong> Provides a predetermined monthly income in retirement based on salary and years of service.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="pension-card">
                    <h3>3. Personal Pensions</h3>
                    <p>If you are self-employed or your employer doesn't offer a pension plan, you can open a personal pension plan. These plans allow you to choose investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals.</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexibility in contribution amounts and investment options.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> The value of your pension is dependent on the performance of your investments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="pension-card">
                    <h3>4. Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs)</h3>
                    <p>SIPPs allow you to have greater control over how your pension funds are invested. You can invest in a wide range of assets, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and commercial property.</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Full control over your investments and the ability to diversify across various asset classes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires investing knowledge and may have higher fees compared to traditional personal pensions.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Pension Plan</h2>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><strong>How Much Can You Contribute?</strong> Consider how much you can afford to contribute to your pension each year.</li>
                <li><strong>What Is Your Risk Tolerance?</strong> Different pension plans carry different levels of investment risk.</li>
                <li><strong>How Long Do You Have Until Retirement?</strong> Younger individuals may take on more risk, while those nearing retirement should focus on stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Will Your Employer Match Contributions?</strong> Employer matching contributions can significantly boost your savings.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Implications:</strong> Understand how contributions and withdrawals will be taxed.</li>

            <h2>Which Pension Plan is Right for You?</h2>
            <p>Choosing the best pension option depends on your unique financial situation, goals, and the type of work you do. It's often recommended to consult a financial advisor to help determine which pension options are most suited for your needs.</p>
